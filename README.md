## Objective
The objective of this project is it observes local area network usage and provides a
statistical display of data in a network. The network display monitor displays the
information that is time stamp, source ip, destination ip, source mac, destination mac,
etc.

## Purpose of Tool
The purpose of this project is to develop an IPv4/IPv6 Network Monitoring Tool
known as a packet analyzer, protocol analyzer or packet sniffer. It is a web based
computer application that can intercept and log traffic passing over a digital network
or part of a network.
As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures packets using
<b>TCPDUMP</b> and, if needed, decodes the packet&#39;s raw data, showing the values of
various fields in the packet, and analyzes its contents according to the appropriate
logical operator or other specifications. When traffic is captured, either the entire
contents of packets can be recorded, or the headers can be recorded without recording
the total content of the packets.
